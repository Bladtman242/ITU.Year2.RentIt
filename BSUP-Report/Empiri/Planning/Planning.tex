With an overview of our activitiesâ€™ dependencies and a clear understanding of our
critical path and activity slack, we were ready to plan the project and establish
deadlines.

When making our actual activity plan for the project, we chose to use a planning
tool called a Gantt chart (or Gantt diagram). This chart shows the
activities on one axis with time on the other, which gives an immediate visual
overview of the chronological order of activities (ours can be seen in Appendix
\ref{app:gantt}).

Since we had valuable knowledge about the dependencies of activities (from the
dependency diagram), we chose a variant of the Gantt chart, which also shows these.
