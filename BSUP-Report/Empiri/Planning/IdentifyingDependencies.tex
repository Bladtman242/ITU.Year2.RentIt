Having identified the various activities needed to be done, we now planned how
to reach the milestones in the project. This time around, we focused on dependencies
between activities (e.g. the \textbf{EXAMPLE1} needed to be done before the
\textbf{EXAMPLE2} because \textbf{xyz}).

To map out dependencies, we used a dependency diagram (which can be found in Appendix
\textbf{REFERENCE}): a network diagram using the activity on-node format\cite{caye}.
In this version of the network diagram, each box (node) represents an activity with
dependencies represented as arrows between them. The method uses the concepts of
\textbf{earliest start time}/\textbf{earliest finish time} and \textbf{latest start
time}/\textbf{latest finish time} in addition to the activityâ€™s own estimated duration.

The EST/EFT can be found by a \emph{forward pass} through the diagram, while the LST/LFTs
can be found by a following \emph{backward pass}. These numbers leave us with the
\emph{critical path}, which consists of those activities that, if delayed, would delay
the whole project (in other words, those that must keep the deadline).

It also gives a clear presentation of the \emph{total slack} (how much an activity can
be postponed), \emph{free slack} (how much an activity can be postponed without affecting
following activities), and \emph{head slack} (how much an activity can be postponed without
delaying the whole project deadline) for each activity.
