\section{Planning}
This section attempts to explain how we planned the course of the project, including what
milestones we set out to reach and what planning methods and artifacts were used to
accomplish this.

After having agreed on a set of project requirements, deadlines, and objectives in
collaboration with the students from Singapore, we needed to plan how to meet those
objectives within the project deadline. As such, we began planning what work needed
to be done and what activities we expected to do in the project.

During the planning process and the associated discussion, it became clear to us that,
in order to make a realistic plan for the project, we needed a more in-depth understanding
of the work and activities lying ahead.
