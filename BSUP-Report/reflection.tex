While working on this project we have gotten some good insights into how different project management tools work in a small project.\\
We have found that in small projects like this one of the most important things is to be able to see the project progress at all times. The SCRUM backlogs are a really intuitive way of monitoring the progress of a project and it works really well with small projects, so that is definately something we would recommend using in situations similar to ours. \\
To make the backlogs useful it is very important that the estimates you produce are accurate. We learned that this is a hard thing to do well and it is a fine balance between time spent estimating and the needed accuracy of the estimates. The use of a workbreakdown structure followed by planning poker worked well for us, but it is quite time consuming and therefor we would only recommend it in smaller projects.

In general we were really happy with working with SCRUM, it seems like a really solid organizational framework which works very well inl projects like this. We can recommend if for all smaller projects in which an iterative approach can be used.
