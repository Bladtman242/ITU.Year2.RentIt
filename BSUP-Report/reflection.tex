\section{Perspective}
We have found that in small projects like this, it is important to be able to see the project progress at all times. The Scrum
backlogs are an intuitive way of monitoring the progress of a project and that is something we
would recommend using in situations similar to ours. Additionally we recommend having a quality plan to make it
easy to assess when a task is done.

We also learned that it is hard to make good estimates, and it is a fine
balance between time spent estimating and the needed accuracy of the estimates.
The use of a work breakdown structure followed by planning poker worked well for
us, but we suspect this to be quite time consuming in larger projects as the task grows exponentially with the
size of the project, and therefore we would only recommend it in smaller
projects. After having estimated, we recommend to make a plan for the project, because without
 this you cannot easily recognize if you are off schedule.

Scrum seems like a solid organizational framework which works well in projects like ours. We
recommend it for smaller projects in which an iterative approach can be
used and it is definately an approach we will use in other similar projects. 

Additionally, we recommend being careful when doing risk management in a project with limited man hours 
as it is easy to spend more time analysing risks than what can be saved by handling these. However, an appropiate amount of 
risk management can prove invaluable, and should be considered for all projects.
