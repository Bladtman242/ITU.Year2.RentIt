\section{Analysis of Quality Plan}
\subsection{Jeg kan ikke finde p√• titler!}
Having a quality plan has made it easy for us to check whether a certain part of the program meets our quality standards. Since it is the same routine for every part of the program, it has proven, in time, to get easier and quicker to do a quality check. Agreeing on what we define as quality also makes it easier for each individual group member to trust that, once a part of the program has gone through quality checking, it is of quality, even if the quality check was done by another group member entirely (gief omformulering?).
