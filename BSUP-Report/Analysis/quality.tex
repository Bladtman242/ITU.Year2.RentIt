\section{Analysis of Quality Plan}
\subsection{Jeg kan ikke finde på titler!}
Having a quality plan has made it easy for us to check whether a certain part of the program meets our quality standards. Since it is the same routine for every part of the program, it has proven, in time, to get easier and quicker to do a quality check. Agreeing on what we define as quality also makes it easier for each individual group member to trust that, once a part of the program has gone through quality checking, it is of quality, even if the quality check was done by another group member entirely (gief omformulering?).

\subsection{Så lader vi også lige som om, at der er en titel her!}
Being able to monitor progress has proven to be very useful during our project. It made it easy for the group to get an overview of how the project was coming along, as well as how the work of each individual member of the group was progressing. Given that the five of us have never worked together on a project before, there was bound to be some difficulties when estimating tasks, and being able to monitor the work of each group member has been a tremendous help when regulating workloads, because it shows how much time group members puts into their assigned tasks.
We think that this could improve our ability to provide correct estimates in the future, at least in this group and on this project, so instead of simply solving problems unbalanced workload distribution, it may, in time, prevent them from occurring entirely.
