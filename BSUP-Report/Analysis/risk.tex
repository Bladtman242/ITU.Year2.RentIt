\section{Analysis of Risk Management}

There are two areas of concern when analyzing the effectiveness of risk management, and the first is
based more on qualified guesses than the other.

The first area is what issues or difficulties we avoided by doing a risk analysis early on, and what
issues we did not predict to have, but still ended up facing. Looking at these will give us an idea
of how much we gain from using a risk analysis.

The second area is issues when using the analysis itself, and how much effort it requires to complete
such an analysis.

These two areas together give us an idea about whether the \emph{benefits} of the risk analysis are
ultimately worth the \emph{effort} required.
