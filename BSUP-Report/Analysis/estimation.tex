\section{Analysis of Estimation Methods}
\subsection{How did it go?}
Planning poker allows every member of the group to give their initial estimate of a task uninfluenced by the estimates given by the rest of the group, because everyone reveals their estimate at the same time. This gives everyone the chance to explain their estimate, perhaps making other group members realize that their initial estimate was wrong, which was the case during several of our SCRUM meetings. It also invites discussions of the different tasks to be estimated which can help to clarify what the task in question is about (people may reach different estimates because they have understood the tasks differently), which is a definite quality we found in using this estimation method.

\subsection{Alternative Estimation Methods}
Seeing how well the planning poker method worked, the Delphi technique might also have been useful as it follows the same idea of letting people change their estimates depending on estimates given by the rest of the group. However, with the Delphi technique being anonymous in the sense that each estimator gives their estimate anonymously, estimators will not be given the chance to explain why they have estimated a given task they way they did. Being anonymous, though, allows estimators to be less concerned about changing their estimate to comply with the rest of the group, if they are certain their estimate is the right one. In some ways this method might be better than the planning poker method because of its anonymity, but being anonymous might also make it less ideal in some circumstances (for example, if two estimators disagree and both refuse to change their estimates).

Another estimation method that might be suitable is the Analysis Effort Method in which the team estimates the effort needed for the analysis part of each individual program function. Then, by considering a series of factors such as team size, familiarity, and complexity, the ratio between analysis, which has now been estimated, and design, coding, and testing. In total, this gives an estimates of the entire project and subtasks of which it is composed. This is a somewhat stricter estimation method than planning poker and the Delphi technique as the factors are less up to interpretation than simply giving a number to represent an estimate. For example, if the team size is known, this factor will always be the same. Leaving less to imagination and interpretation of the factors used to determine the estimate could be useful in groups that are less experienced in estimates (like our own) as there is a template to follow.
