\section{Introduction}

We are a team of five students at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU) studying Software
Development, currently on our second year (4th semester).

We will, as basis for this report, be working with a group of students from the Singapore
Management University (SMU) to develop an application that allows users to buy and rent
movies and songs. The application consists of a server, developed by the ITU students,
and a browser-based client developed by the SMU students.

The authors of this report are Niclas Benjamin Tollstorff (nben@itu.dk), Niels Liljedal
Christensen (nlch@itu.dk), Sigurt Bladt Dinesen (sidi@itu.dk, Kristian Brink Gansted
(kbri@itu.dk), and Niels Roesen Abildgaard (nroe@itu.dk).

The Singaporean team is made up of Chai Ching Hsiang Robert, Tan Kah How Kelvin, and
Chong Wen Xiong Nick.

As a part of the course “System Development and Project Organisation” we have learned
about several tools and methods to use in a software development context.

The basis for these methods is the book “Project Management for Information Systems”
(5th edition) by James Cadle and Donald Yeates, which explains several of these as well
as which situations they may be used in.

This report is our attempt of trying out the methods to figure out which methods are
usable in what cases in order to affirm the recommended uses or define new cases in
which the methods may be used.

During the project we used Scrum as a framework for our development and explored several
areas of project management, including risk management and estimation.
