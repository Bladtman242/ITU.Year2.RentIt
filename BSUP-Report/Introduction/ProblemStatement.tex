\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemstatement}
Cadle \& Yeates' book \cite{caye} introduces several methods and tools for easing the
development of software, assisting project management of information systems.

Through a use-case study of an international project the methods and their use
is explored and shown in a real environment.

This report details various problems we faced during our project and what
methods were used to overcome them. In a use case study, the report aims to
detail what problems arose during our project, and which methods are
recommended in such situations.  Issues that arose during the project are
listed and paired with the methods we used to overcome them.

The effectiveness of all the methods used is analyzed with an aim to determine
how useful each method is. The analysis is based on the teamâ€™s experiences with
the methods and is purely qualitative.

We also examine how features of organizational structures and methodologies
(such as Scrum) can be used to improve product quality and deadline-adherence
in a small software-development project as well as how Scrum affects teams in
a Global Software Development situation.
