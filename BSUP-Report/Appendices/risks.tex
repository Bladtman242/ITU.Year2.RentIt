\subsubsection{Technical Risks}
\begin{description}
    \item[T1 New development environment] In the project we will be working with an unfamiliar
        framework (.NETâ€™s WCF) and server technology (IIS). If any problems arise with these
        technologies they will considerably lengthen the project scope as no member of the team
        would have the required familiarity to quickly solve such a problem. On the other hand
        it is not very likely that any problems should arise as WCF is used through C#, a
        programming language the entire team is familiar with, and the interface to the IIS-server
        is very much like using Windows on a desktop computer.\newline
