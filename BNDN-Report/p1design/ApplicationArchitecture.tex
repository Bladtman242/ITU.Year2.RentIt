When designing the general architecture of the application, we decided on a simple, layered approach.
This was done to separate any business logic from actual presentational code. In the case of an online
API, the actual API is the presentational part (not to be confused with the client, which was developed
separately from the server).

The \verb+JsonService+ project\footnote{Here, project is used in the context of
a Visual Studio project: a compilable collection of code.} uses the logic
available through the \verb+Backend+ library. Each of these has a test library
tied to it. The \verb+Backend+ utilizes a MSSQL database.
