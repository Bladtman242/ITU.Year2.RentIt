\section{Business Case}
In this section we will give a brief introduction to our chosen business case, as to introduce the reader to the developed system.

With this project we've wanted to adress the problem of piracy in the media industry, by the means of legal alternatives. Piracy is an often committed illegal activity, with recent research showing that around 30\% of 15-29 year-olds (in Denmark) engage in piracy of movies and tv-shows \cite{pirates}.
This same study showed that most pirates would prefer to acquire their media in legal ways, but there is a lack of options with the same high accessibility, which points them in the illegal direction.

Our service will provide a accessible way for customers to acquire media in legal ways. As such, a user will be able to either buy or rent media, which enables him to either stream it or download it directly from our service. The service is based on the media types of movies and songs.  While the current big brands in the media streaming business is focused on one of these media types e.g. NetFlix (movies/series) or Spotify (music), we aim to keep the user's media gathered in one single service. We believe that having all your media stored in one service is convenient with the upcoming era of smart tvs and media centers \cite{smarttv}. Our service will use an on-demand business model in order to strengthen the accessiblity of single movies.

In conclusion our service is a multi-media on-demand service, with both purchase and rental options.
