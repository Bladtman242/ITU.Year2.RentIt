\section{Business Case}
In this section we will give a brief introduction to our chosen business case, as to introduce the reader to the developed system.

\subsection{Business opportunity}
With this project we've wanted to adress the problem of piracy in the media industry. Piracy is an often committed illegal activity, with recent research showing that around 30\% of 15-29 year-olds (in Denmark) engage in piracy of movies and tv-shows \cite{pirates}. This same study showed that most pirates would prefer to acquire their media in legal ways, but there is a lack of options with the same high accessibility, which points them in the illegal direction.

Based on the study mentioned above, we believe that we can adress the problem of piracy, by providing an accessible way for customers to acquire media in legal ways.

\subsection{Concept explained}
We aim to provide a service, which allows users to buy and rent movies and songs. Upon purchase, the user will be able to both stream and download the media directly from our service, as \textbf{accessiblity is a key quality in the service}.

We hope to convert media pirates, who wants to acquire media in a legal manner, but simply lacks the means to do so. This is to be achieved through high accessibility of our media. However, since media streaming is popular\cite{ott} we do not wish to restrict ourselves to this segment, as we believe a typical  family will have interest in our service too.

While big brands already exist in the media streaming industry, e.g. NetFlix (movies/series) or Spotify (music), our concept differs in certain ways, as detailed below:

Firstly, we keep both movies and media gathered in one single service. We believe that, in the upcoming era of smart tvs and media centers \cite{smarttv}, it will be desireable to have media stored in one application rather than having the \emph{media center} scattered across several apps.

Secondly, we are do not use the \emph{Recurring Revenue model (Subscription model)}\cite{businessmodel}. Our users are not limited by a subscription peroid in which they can access their media. Instead, a bought item will be treated as their property, free for download or streaming at any time, thus providing high accessiblity. In addition, recent research\cite{ott} has predicted that subscription services will not dominate in the future, while other forms of digital content distribution will.

\subsection{Impacts and risks}
Our concept has several risks associated with it. Since streaming services has been around for several years the technology needed has become mature, and as such we have few risks associated with the technology aspects. The technology risk with the largest impact on the business, is that we cannot find a fullfilling security mechanism for the downloaded files, (ironically) making them easily shareable. Note that we have found feasibility tests of this mechanism to be out of scope in this assignment.

The other risks, with large impact, are external factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item A solid customer base is not achieved.
\item A partnership with content providers is not achieved.
\end{itemize}

These risks are mostly concerned with marketing, and strategies to avoid them is considered out of scope for this assignment.
