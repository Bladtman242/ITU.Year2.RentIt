\subsection{Requirements}
As part of the analysis, we need a set of requirements for our product to
establish what users will and will not be able to do with the system. This
section describes and discusses our choice of requirements and use cases.

We did not immediately arrive at our current requirements. They have changed
over a series of iterations in which we revised and discussed them internally in
the group, as well as with the Singaporean team. For example, our first draft of
requirements did not include songs at all. It was not until the Singaporean team
told us that they were required by their professor to include songs in their
service that this became part of our requirements. The Singaporean team also
made suggestions that media files include ratings and view count to allow us to
sort by rating and popularity. In general, the requirements were almost
exclusively changed on request by the Singaporean team. We, the ITU team,
naturally had few additions to our initial specification.

There are two types of primary actors: users and managers. A manager’s rights are a
superset of a regular user’s rights. In addition, managers do not have to
purchase anything.


\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{app:usecases}
\textbf{Users:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A user must be able to login, register, and edit an account.
\item A user may deposit money into her account, to be used for later
	purchases.
\item A user must be able to overview movies/songs by the following categories:
	lexicographically, by release date, genre, rating, and popularity.
\item A user must be able to locate a specific movie/song through text search,
	matching movies with any property matching the text string.
\item A movie must have properties describing title of movie/song, year of
	release, director(s), genre(s) of movie, and a textual description.
\item A user must be able to purchase a movie/song, which will then be
	associated with her account.
\item A user must be able to rent a movie/song, which will then be associated
	with her account for 2 days.
\item A user must be able to watch any movie/song associated with her account
	in the browser, as long as it is still available through the service.
\item A user must be able to download any movie/song associated with her
	account, as long as it is still available through the service.
\item A user must be able to find all movies/songs that are or have been
	associated with her account, as long it is still available through the
	service (ie. movies the user has purchased or rented at a given time).
\item A user must be able to find all movies/songs that are associated with her
	account, as long it is still available through the service (ie. movies
	that the user can watch at the given time).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Managers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A manager's rights extend those of the user, so that a manager can do
	everything the user can, without purchase.
\item A manager must be able to upload movies/songs as well as provide
	properties and prices to them.
\item A manager must be able to delete movies/songs from the service.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Security and other Design Decisions} When deciding on the
requirements for the system, several criteria are considered, and some
requirements which might be crucial in a real-life product are left out. These
decisions are mainly made on the basis that this is an educational project,
making these requirements more or less irrelevant to the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item We decided to leave out user authentication in our web services, so given
	the URL, anyone can download a movie our song without authenticating.
	The data structure does, however, support user authentication with each
	user having a password.
\item In a real-life renting service such as iTunes, once a user starts playing
	the movie that she has just rented, the movie will only be available
	for viewing in the next 48 hours. When a user rents and downloads a
	movie or song using our service, they can keep the file for as long as
	they want. However, the file is only available for download for a
	limited period of time.
\item Naturally, we have not implemented a real payment service but rather a
	"fake" balance where people can deposit money to their account, for use
	when purchasing or renting movies and songs.
\end{itemize}
