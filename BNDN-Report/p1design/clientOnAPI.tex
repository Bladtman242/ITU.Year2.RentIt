\subsection{Evaluation of the API}
\label{sec:evalapi}

Only a single requirement caused an issue during development of the client:
demotion of managers to users and promotion the other way. As the feature
had a fairly low priority, the issue was not discovered until late in the
development process.

The issue arises because a manager has no way of getting a list of users. This
is neither supported in the service nor in the client (specifications and
implementations). Listing users is required to access user profiles, which, in
turn, is required to de- or promote them.

This is a scary example of how incomplete requirements can result in huge problems much
later in development. Solving the problem at this point would require changes to
the API specification and backend service on top of the already required changes
to the client.
