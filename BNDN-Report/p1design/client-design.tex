\subsection{Client Design}

When designing the client we first looked through the requirements (listed in
Section \ref{sec:requirements}) to decide which features would need to be
developed in the client. Most features had root in the server but required a
layer in the client as well, and a few were to be developed in the client only.
A few requirements were not implemented in the service, and were hence dropped
for the client (see Section \ref{sec:futureimps}).

After prioritizing the list of features, we developed it into a list of views,
each view representing something a user of the client would see (see Appendix
\ref{app:client-views}). Each feature was not necessarily exactly one view (most
views contained several features).

For example, \emph{Manager overview} view were to provide "functionality for
uploading/creating new movies and songs" and "for promoting/demoting
manageres), covering requirements 26 to 30,

We then implemented the views, feature by feature. This means that some views
were first developed in an \emph{incomplete} state, with the most highly
prioritized feature, and then later developed into the full planned view.
