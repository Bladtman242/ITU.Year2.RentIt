\subsection{Client Design}

When designing the client we first looked through the requirements (listed in
Section \ref{sec:requirements}) to decide which features would need to be
developed in the client. Most features had root in the server but required a
layer in the client as well, and a few were to be developed in the client only.
A few requirements were not implemented in the service, and were hence dropped
for the client (see Section \ref{sec:futureimps}).

Requirement 25, which details that managers should have access to
all movies and songs for free, is implemented mostly in the client. If the user
that is logged into the system is a manager, the buy and rent button are hidden,
and the buttons for downloading or watching the material are shown instead. There
is some validation in the web service, but the majority of the implementation lies
in the client.

After prioritizing the list of features, we developed it into a list of views,
each view representing something a user of the client would see (see Appendix
\ref{app:client-views}). Each feature was not necessarily exactly one view (most
views contained several features).

For example, \emph{Manager overview} view were to provide "functionality
for uploading/creating new movies and songs", covering requirements 26 to 28.

We then implemented the views, feature by feature. This means that some views
were first developed in an \emph{incomplete} state, with the most highly
prioritized feature, and then later developed into the full planned view.
