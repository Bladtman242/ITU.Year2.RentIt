\subsection{Web service Tests}
The tests for the web service itself were supposed to ensure the presence,
parameter adherence, and response correctness of the endpoints themselves.
While the tests are close to being complete, the C# methods for setting the http
responses' status codes were so unfamiliar, that it was completed only for part
of the API. This intensified a mistake made in the tests; the http status codes
were tested together with the other criteria, rather than in separate test
methods. The two problems in conjunction resulted in the web service not passing
its tests. This made it impossible
