\subsection{Web service Tests}
The tests for the web service itself were supposed to ensure the presence,
parameter adherence, and response correctness of the endpoints themselves.
While the tests are close to being complete, the C\# methods for setting the
http responses' status codes were so unfamiliar, that they were implemented only
for a part of the API. This intensified a mistake made in the tests; the http
status codes were tested together with the other criteria, rather than in
separate test methods. The two problems in conjunction resulted in the web
service not passing its tests. This made it impossible to use the test suite for
change acceptance, thus rendering the web service test useless. There is
something to be said for feasibility testing critical functionality here, but
the problem would have been insignificant, had the tests for status codes been
separated from the rest.

Rather than creating expectancy tables for a set of incomplete, non-passing
tests, we refer to the initial draft for the web service tests, as seen in
appendix \ref{app:jsontest}.
