\subsection{Client Tests}

We
chose not to try and have automated tests of the client, as it is pretty much
just a user interface, and testing user interfaces is tricky and a very
changeable field in software development.

\textbf{REFERENCES FOR ABOVE!}

This section describes how the requirements have been tested using a black-box type test, in which we only test that a certain input has the right outcome. The tests were all carried out manually.

\subsubsection{User Tests}
The following tests regard the functionality accessible by regular users. \\
