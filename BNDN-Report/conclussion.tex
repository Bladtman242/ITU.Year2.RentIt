\section{Conclusion}
Finishing the project with only few requirements unfulfilled (refer sections
\ref{sec:requirements} and \ref{sec:evalapi}), it is fair to say the finish
line has been reached. All central requirements are met, and while we could
have been better at anticipating problems in communicating with the
Singaporeans, there were no problems that we could not work out in the end.
Despite working out the communication problems that occurred, the time spent 
actually working them out could have been used on other parts of the project, 
which may have resulted in more, if not all, of our requirements being fulfilled.
There is still room for improvement in the client, but it serves well as a
demonstration of the web service's capabilities.
