\section{Conclusion}
Finishing the project with only few requirements unfulfilled (refer sections
\ref{sec:requirements} and \ref{sec:evalapi}), it is fair to say the finish
line has been reached. All central requirements are met, and while we could
have been better at anticipating problems in communicating with the
Singaporean fuck-nuts, there were no problems that we could not solve in the end.
