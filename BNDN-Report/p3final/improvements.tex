\subsection{Future improvements}
In this section we will discuss what things we would have added or improved if we were to continue working with Moofy.

\textbf{Close account } We would like for a user to be able to close his account. As the system currently is only admins can delete an account,
and that feature just deletes the account it does not take funds or media assosciated with the account into consideration. We would like for a
user to be able to close his account but open it later with his media and funds still available to him. This should not be too complicated to 
implement but due to the time restrictions on the project we did not have time to implement it.

\textbf{Loading indicator } Another feature we would like to have in the future is a loading indicator that shows when content is being loaded in the client. 
Currently the user has no way of knowing if content is being loaded and may think that something has  gone wrong. A loading indicator would fix this issue 
and it would be fairly simple to implement however code would have to be added in a lot of places, and this feature was not a priority for us to get done so
we chose to focus on the report instead.

\textbf{Better streaming} Currently then video "streaming" is using the html video tag utility, however this is not actually streaming the movie, it is just
a http request spiced up with some buffering and such gettting the movie. Had we had more time we would like to have added a more sophisticated method
of streaming. This would also help on the next issue as the video tag is not supported in all browsers and different browsers support different file types, for
instance Mozilla Firefox does not support mp4 files in the video tag.

\textbf{Support more browsers?} The client we are currently using
