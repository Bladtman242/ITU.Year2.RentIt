"The POST requests do return a value (refer to google document). If you do not
see these it is an issue on your side.

Honestly I am quite annoyed by the tone especially in your recent
communications. We tried very hard to get the specifications locked down in the
first weeks of the project where you did not put very much time into the
project. We have told you that the current period of tine is our holidays.
Despite this you seem to have only now actually thought about what you expect
from us, constantly coming up with new requirements. This should have been
communicated earlier and you cannot expect us to be able to do everything you
require now.

I believe the project will be much more succesful if we respect each other and
each other's estimates. We would like a higher level of willingness to
compromise.

On a final note if you really require ratings you could look into the IMDb api."
